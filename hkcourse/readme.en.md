# Welcome to Mindspore Study Group 

This is a two-day short-term course for non-computer major's students who interested in AI or computer major's students who are new to AI.  After this course, you can get:
* Familiar with the basic concepts in the field of Artificial Intelligence, with certain self-learning ability.
* Clarify the correspondence between the problems in your professional scene and the classic tasks of Artificial Intelligence
* Complete the code independently to implement an image classification task on the MindSpore framework, with clarifying how to use visualization and other auxiliary modules to optimize your learning process
* Understand the latest research fields, such as device-cloud collaboration, automated machine learning, unsupervised learning tasks, etc., to clarify the direction for future research
